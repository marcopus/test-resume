            <h1>Who</h1>
            <p>
                I am Marco Marra. I was born in 1989 in a remote village in the south of Italy nobody should care about.
                <br>I live in The Netherlands. I have one daughter and a few plants.
                <br>
                I am into skating (ice- or inline, depending on the season), playing the guitar and the Hammond organ, of which I proudly own one exemplar.
                <br>
                I consume books and videos about software development. Ask me for tips.

            <h1>What</h1>
            <p>
                If you landed here, it's because you are either curious or looking for help.
                <br>
                I am a passionate problem solver and I can help you with your technical challenges.
                <br>
                I am really not into websites, really. Not even this one. GPT-4o made it for me. So I cannot help you building your next awesome website. Sorry.
                <br>
                I have an agile mindset and I think in terms of business value when navigating the realm of technical decisions around complex software problems.
                <br>
                In practice, what I can help you and/or your tech team with:
                <ul><strong>Refactoring</strong>:
                    Your project relies on a legacy codebase which has become difficult to change. I can help you to unstuck, simplify and modernize your application so that changing it becomes less painful.
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Microservices</strong>:
                    You've heard of them, you've read about them, you've seen them in action. But you are not sure how to start. I can help you to design and implement a microservices architecture that fits your needs.
                </ul>
                <ul><strong></strong></ul>
            </p>
