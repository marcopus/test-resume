            <h1>What's this site</h1>
            <p>
                If you landed here, it's because you are either curious or looking for help.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a passionate problem solver and I can help you with your technical challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                In practice, I can help you with:
                <ul><strong>Application design</strong>
                    I can help you to design your application in a way that it is scalable, maintainable, and testable. I can help you to make the right technical decisions that will make your application future-proof.
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Refactoring</strong>
                    Whether your project relies on old legacy code, it has evolved in a fast-paced environment, resulting in technical debt, chances are that it has become increasingly difficult to change. I can help you to simplify and modernize your application so that it becomes less painful for you and your team to evolve it.
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Microservices</strong>
                    You've heard of them, you've read about them, you've seen them in action. But you are not sure how to start. I can help you to design and implement a microservices architecture that fits your needs.
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>CI/CD</strong>
                    An automated and robust process for building, testing, and deploying your application is a must-have in modern software development. I can help you to set up a CI/CD pipeline that fits your project and team.
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Agile teams</strong>
                    I can guide your team in prioritizing fast iterations, shortening feedback loops, and delivering value to your users early on in the development cycle. I can help you to set up a DevOps culture within your team.
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I have an agile mindset and I expect the same from our collaboration. I think in terms of business value when navigating the realm of technical decisions around complex software problems. That equates for me (and I hope also for you) maximizing users' satisfaction through safe, robust and useful software.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't build websites. Sorry.

            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Marco Marra. I was born in 1989 in a remote village in the south of Italy [nobody should ever care about]. I've lived in The Netherlands for about a third of my life now. You can do the math. I have one daughter and a few plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am into Raspberry Pis and home media projects. I plan to write about them some day. Of all sports out there I only really enjoy skating (ice- or inline, depending on the season). Sometimes, I play the guitar, I once tried to learn the piano, and I have this thing for the Hammond organ, of which I proudly own one exemplar. I listen to jazz (not exclusively) and I love ramen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I consume books, videos and articles related to software development. I am big fan of the Agile Manifesto and the principles behind it. The Pragmatic Programmer has become my go-to resource over the years and it has made me a better programmer.
